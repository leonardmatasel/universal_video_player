# per essere sicuro che risponde ai cambiamenti del controller usa:
```dart
AnimatedBuilder(
animation: Listenable.merge([
controller,
// ascolta isFullScreen o altri state update
controller.sharedPlayerNotifier,
// ascolta il cambiamento del widget video
]),
builder: (context, _) {
final player = controller.sharedPlayerNotifier.value;

        final shouldRender = isFullScreenDisplay == controller.isFullScreen;

        return Center(
          child: AspectRatio(
            aspectRatio: aspectRatio,
            child:
                shouldRender
                    ? (player ?? const SizedBox.shrink())
                    : const SizedBox.shrink(),
          ),
        );
