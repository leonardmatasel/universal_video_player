/// A widget that listens to navigation route changes and triggers callbacks
/// when the route stack changes relative to this widget's route.
///
/// Useful for responding to navigation events such as:
/// - When the current route becomes visible again after popping another route (`onPopNext`).
/// - When the current route is popped (`onPop`).
/// - When a new route is pushed on top of the current route (`onPushNext`).
/// - When the current route is pushed onto the stack (`onPush`).
///
/// The widget subscribes to a global route observer to track these changes,
/// and automatically unsubscribes when disposed.
///
/// This widget is often used to pause/resume media playback or update UI state
/// based on navigation stack changes.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// RouteAwareListener(
///   onPopNext: (route) => resumePlayback(),
///   onPop: () => cleanup(),
///   child: YourWidget(),
/// )
/// ```

  /// Called when the top route has been popped off, and the current route shows up.

  /// Called when the current route has been popped off.

  /// Called when a new route has been pushed, and the current route is no longer visible.
  final void Function(Route route)? onPushNext;

  /// Called when the current route has been pushed.
  final VoidCallback? onPush;
